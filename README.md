# Skeleton for Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python

This repository is a Python package skeleton (`mypackage`) designed with Test-Driven Development (TDD) in mind. It provides a clear and organized starting point for Python projects, encouraging the practice of writing tests before implementing functionality.

The structure includes dedicated directories for your package code (`my_package/my_package`) and unit tests (`my_package/tests`), making it easy to follow TDD principles and ensuring that your code is reliable and well-tested. See [README](my_package/README.md) under `my_package` for a detailed explanation of the directory structure and instructions how to run unit tests using test discovery.
